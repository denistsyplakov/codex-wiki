/**
 * Claude Code Hook helper — "have the harness elements changed, and did we already report them
 * this session?" (not a hook entry point itself).
 *
 * The four project-context events an `artisyn` upload can carry — `system-context`,
 * `skill-definitions`, `agent-definitions`, `mcp-config` — describe the HARNESS (CLAUDE.md files,
 * the skill and agent catalogs, the MCP server list), not the session. Until T-105 they were
 * prepended to every uploaded `artisyn` body, which on this repo meant 573 KB of identical bytes
 * per file: an 1,811-byte session log shipped as 581 KB, and a 2,399-file backlog moved ~1.3 GB of
 * duplicated catalog. The server has always upserted this data **per repository**
 * (`upsertHarnessElements(tx, repoId, …)` in `logs.service.ts`) and explicitly skips the upsert when
 * the events are absent rather than clearing what it already knows, so sending them once is not a
 * data loss — it is what the receiving side was already built for.
 *
 * Change detection is by **last-modified time**, deliberately: the three builders already stat every
 * file they describe and carry `lastModified` on each entry, so the fingerprint costs nothing beyond
 * the walk that was happening anyway, and needs no content hashing of the 521 KB of skill bodies.
 * mtime is not a perfect change oracle (a touch with no edit re-reports; an edit that preserves
 * mtime does not) — accepted for this use, since the consequence either way is one redundant or one
 * delayed catalog upsert, never wrong session data.
 *
 * Reported at most ONCE PER SESSION, and the decision is frozen at the session's first full upload
 * run: a skill edited mid-session is reported by the NEXT session, not by this session's next
 * `Stop`. That is what keeps a long session with many `Stop`s from paying the 573 KB repeatedly, and
 * it is why the state records which session it was decided for, not just the fingerprint.

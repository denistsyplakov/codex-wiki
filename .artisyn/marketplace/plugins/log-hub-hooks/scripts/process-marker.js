/**
 * Claude Code Hook helper — provenance markers for, and reliable reaping of, every child process
 * this hook spawns (not a hook entry point itself).
 *
 * Two related jobs, both about children we launch:
 *
 * 1. `buildProcessMarkerEnv()` stamps a child's environment with what it is, who launched it and
 *    when. This exists because hook-spawned children DO leak: an audit of this machine found six
 *    orphaned `cmd.exe /c mcp-server-postgres` wrappers up to five days old, with no way to tell
 *    which hook run, session or role each belonged to — the command line alone says
 *    "some MCP server", not "the T-105 upload run's per-file probe from session X at 14:38".
 *    Anything spawned here now carries that answer with it.
 *
 * 2. `killProcessTree()` is why there were six of them. On Windows, a child started with the
 *    `shell: true` option is a `cmd.exe` wrapper and the real program is its GRANDchild, so
 *    `child.kill()` reaps the wrapper and orphans the server, which then survives until reboot.
 *    Every place this hook kills a `shell: true` child must go through here instead.
 *
 * Note on reading the markers back: env vars are the right carrier (they are inherited by the whole
 * subtree, cost nothing, and never change a command line), but Windows does NOT expose another
 * process's environment through `Win32_Process` — only through the PEB. So on Windows these are
 * readable from inside the child (and by anything the child reports to, e.g. hook.log), and from
 * outside only with a PEB reader such as Sysinternals Process Explorer. On Linux/macOS
 * `/proc/<pid>/environ` and `ps eww` show them directly. The markers are therefore for attribution
 * and post-mortem, not a substitute for `killProcessTree()` actually working.
 */

 * Shared prefix for every marker variable. Deliberately distinct from `ARTISYN_HOOK_SERVICE`

 * codebase reads them to make a decision (see MARKER_PREFIX), which is what keeps that true.
 *
 * @param {string} role - what the process IS, in `<kind>` or `<kind>:<detail>` form, e.g.
 *   `'mcp-probe:playwright'`, `'claude-invoke:haiku'`, `'otel-receiver'`. Free-form but keep it
 *   stable and greppable — this is the field a human scans first.

/**
 * Kill a spawned child and everything below it, best-effort and never throwing.

 * On Windows, `taskkill /T` walks the tree so a `shell: true` wrapper cannot orphan the program it

 * the caller continues rather than racing a detached killer we would then have to trust — with
 * `windowsHide` for the same reason every other subprocess in this hook passes it (see
 * `spawn-hidden.js` and the `__tests__/no-visible-window.test.js` regression pin). The added
 * latency is one `taskkill` per probed server per RUN, not per uploaded file.
 *
 * Elsewhere `child.kill()` already reaches the real program, because there is no wrapper process
 * in between.
